# Chapter 2 â€” Development and Production are Two Very Different Things

* Development is inherently different from production.
* Production mentality can be _fatal_ to development environment.
* To manage _thinking workers_, take _approaches opposite_ production management.
* Proposed **Opposite Approaches**
    * _Permit errors_. Sometimes, scrapping a failed attempt and starting anew is cheaper than trying to salvage a bad design.
    * _Don't Kick Workers in the Ass_. There is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be "supplemented" by that of the boss.
    * _Appreciate People's Uniqueness_. Some employees are irreplaceable. Realize individuals' uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective.
    * _Consider how members fit into a team effort as a whole_. Don't just evaluate people on their steady state characteristics (how much they can code or document). Some may simply serve as a catalyst which is a valuable addition to the team.
    * _Make time for things other than just "doing" work_. Things like brainstorming, investigating new methods, figuring out how to avoid subtasks, reading, training, team building events, etc. _The average software developer doesn't own a single book on his or her work and hasn't ever read one._
