# Chapter 5 â€” Parkinson's Law

* Parkinson humorously said: "Work expands to fill the time allotted to it."
* It is almost certainly not true of your people if they enjoy their jobs.
* If someone is not pulling their  weight, it is usually for one of the following reasons:
    * Lack of competence
    * Lack of confidence
    * Lack of affiliation with team members or project goals
* _Bottom line_: Most of the time, applying more schedule pressure will only demotivate and demean
* In rare occasions where leaning on someone is the only option, it should come from the team not the manager.
* Project Estimation vs. Productivity
    * Worst = management sets estimated deadline
    * Better = developers set estimated deadline
    * Best = independent analyst sets estimated deadline
* A True Variation of Parkinson's Law
    * Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day.
    * Frighteningly true for many organizations
