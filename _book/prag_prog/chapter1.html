<p><em>Pragmatic Programmers</em> look beyond the immediate problem they are solving and ask &#x201C;How does my code fit into the larger context? What impact does it have on the project as a whole?&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="the-cat-ate-my-source-code">The Cat Ate my Source Code</h2>
<ol>
<li>Responsibility is something you actively agree to (i.e. you have the right <em>not</em> to take responsibility for an impossible situation!)</li>
<li><strong>TIP 3: PROVIDE OPTIONS, NOT EXCUSES</strong><ol>
<li>When plans fall through and you&apos;re not able to fulfill your obligation, make arrangements/contingencies/alternatives not excuses</li>
<li>Don&apos;t say &#x201C;it can&apos;t be done,&#x201D; figure out what <em>can</em> be done</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="software-entropy">Software Entropy</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What causes &#x201C;software rot&#x201D; around our office?</strong><br>
The authors tell us, &#x201C;There are many factors that can contribute to software rot. The most important one seems to be the psychology, or culture, at work on a project.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Software Rot:</strong> when <em>disorder</em> increases in a software system</li>
<li>Despite the best plans, people, technology, tools, etc., a project can still experience decay</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some broken windows in our projects and how can we board them up or fix them?</strong><br>
Duplicated validation rules in MICAPS, inconsistent user experiences (different error messages for the same error, different labels for buttons that do the same thing), code that&apos;s not unit tested, processes that should be automated but aren&apos;t, ignored browser errors and compiler warnings, outdated APIs, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>TIP 4: DON&apos;T LIVE WITH BROKEN WINDOWS</strong> <ol>
<li>Fix each one as soon as it is discovered</li>
<li>If you don&apos;t have time to fix it properly, <em>board it up</em> and record it to be fixed later at a set time &#x2014; set a deadline and a reminder so it&apos;s not forgotten</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Boarding up broken windows: <ol>
<li>Document it and assign responsibility for it (e.g. a JIRA ticket)</li>
<li>Log a message (e.g. Log4j TRACE message)</li>
<li>Notify the end user/tester (e.g. return an HTTP &#x201C;503 Service Unavailable&#x201D; message, display a pop-up, etc.)</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stone-soup-and-boiled-frogs">Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some examples of times we have made &#x201C;stone soup&#x201D;? What are some &#x201C;stone soup&#x201D; projects we should undertake?</strong><br>
MICAPS7 was a &#x201C;stone soup&#x201D; project. We realized it was quickly becoming more costly, error-prone, and time-consuming to maintain it than it would be to rebuild it using modern architecture and technology. A PLMS/LOGWAY merger is a &#x201C;stone soup&#x201D;-worthy project because PLMS is an antiquated, desktop application with code that is riddled with broken windows. The responsibilities of PLMS and LOGWAY overlap and complement each other in such a way that a single application could nicely replace them both and benefit the end users in many ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Sometimes <em>you have to be the catalyst</em></li>
<li>There are times when you must be prepared to &#x201C;beg for forgiveness&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;asking for permission&#x201D; &#x2014; especially when your end goal is in everyone&apos;s best interest</li>
<li><em>Start-up Fatigue</em>: people guarding their resources, wanting to form committees, required budget approvals</li>
<li><em>Prototypes</em> and <em>Wireframes</em> are good tools for the authors&apos; (pg. 8) solution, &#x201C;Work out what you can reasonably ask for. Develop it well. Once you&apos;ve got it, show people, and let them marvel.&#x201D;</li>
<li>People find it easier to join an ongoing success. &#x2014;  pg. 8</li>
<li><strong>TIP 5: BE THE CATALYST FOR CHANGE</strong><ol>
<li>Be the person who builds the prototype or wireframe</li>
<li>Be the person who writes &#x201C;the way forward&#x201D; presentation or the proposal paper</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are the consequences of putting off fixing or boarding up broken windows? Who is the &#x201C;boiled frog&#x201D;?</strong><br>
The &#x201C;boiled frog&#x201D; the authors mention is a metaphor for developers who grow too comfortable with the broken windows in their project; in fact, they grow so comfortable that the project reaches a point where it cannot be salvaged. Hopefully, if that time comes, someone steps up and makes <em>stone soup</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="good-enough-software">Good-enough Software</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some tools/techniques we can use to make ourselves and the customers comfortable with the thought of deploying imperfect software?</strong><br>
Provide meaningful error messages when things go wrong. Provide the end-users with access to logging output so they can include it in error reports or provide it to a help desk agent. Record all logging output to the database or a rolling log file. Integrate a bug reporting form into the application.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Software should be &#x201C;good enough&#x201D;: it needn&apos;t be perfect</li>
<li><strong>TIP 7: MAKE QUALITY A REQUIREMENTS ISSUE</strong><ol>
<li>Reach an agreement on <em>acceptable</em> quality for each release</li>
<li>Document these expectations</li>
<li>Ensure they agree the document is accurate</li>
<li>Hold yourself to the document &#x2014; only exceed the expectations if you have time and resources and if nothing else takes a back seat</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Code, and the system it&apos;s a part of, <em>will never be perfect</em>. <em>Know when to stop.</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="your-knowledge-portfolio">Your Knowledge Portfolio</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What are some resources for building our knowledge portfolios?</strong><br>
What you&apos;re doing now! Read forums and tech news (e.g. slashdot, hacker news). Join IEEE and read their Computer, IEEE Spectrum, or Software magazines.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>As the value of your knowledge declines, so does your value to your company or client. &#x2014; pg. 12</li>
<li><strong>TIP 8: INVEST REGULARLY IN YOUR KNOWLEDGE PORTFOLIO</strong><ol>
<li><em>Invest regularly</em>: read &#x2014; always; stay informed of new trends, technologies, techniques, tools</li>
<li><em>Diversify</em>: try out different languages and frameworks; test new tools; study other areas of application development (we mainly deal with reporting/logistics apps, try out a big data project, build a game, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Manage risk</em>: practice safe bets (business/enterprise apps) and a few risky ones (games, IOT, uncommon languages)</li>
<li><em>Buy low, sell high</em>: pick an emerging technology that looks promising (AI, Go, Rust) and play with it</li>
<li><em>Review and rebalance</em>: evaluate your skillset as if you were hunting a new job...how marketable are you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>TIP 9: CRITICALLY ANALYZE WHAT YOU READ AND HEAR</strong> &#x2014; just because a language, IDE, API, or process is new/shiny/popular doesn&apos;t mean it&apos;s sound or effective. Think!</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="communicate">Communicate</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How can we communicate better in our code?</strong><br>
Read the book &#x201C;Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Craftsmanship&#x201D; by Robert C. Martin</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Nearly everything we do involves communicating (e-mails, meetings, messaging, naming variables and functions, commenting code, etc.) &#x2014; we&apos;d better do it well:<ol>
<li>Know what needs to be communicated: <ol>
<li>What does this function do? </li>
<li>What does this variable store? </li>
<li>What&apos;s the main idea of this e-mail?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Know your audience: <ol>
<li>If a developer 5 years from now comes along and I&apos;m not here to explain this code, can he/she figure out what&apos;s going on and maintain it? </li>
<li>Is this e-mail going to be read by a technical or non-technical person?</li>
<li>What do I hope to accomplish by communicating with this person?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Choose your moment: when&apos;s the best time for the audience to get the message?</li>
<li>Choose a style: pithy; concise; downright poetic; collegiate with flowing prose and 7 syllable words</li>
<li>Make it look good: sometimes presentation is every bit, if not more, important that content</li>
<li>Get back to people: don&apos;t forget to respond to e-mails; keep interested parties in the loop</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>TIP 10: IT&apos;S BOTH WHAT YOU SAY AND THE WAY YOU SAY IT</strong> &#x2014; sometimes, presentation is every bit, if not more, important than content<ol>
<li><strong>W</strong>hat do you want them to learn?</li>
<li>What is their <strong>i</strong>nterest in what you&#x2019;ve got to say?</li>
<li>How <strong>s</strong>ophisticated are they?</li>
<li>How much <strong>d</strong>etail do they want?</li>
<li>Whom do you want to <strong>o</strong>wn the information?</li>
<li>How can you <strong>m</strong>otivate them to listen to you?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
