# Chapter 3 â€” Be Wary of Overtime and Workaholics

* Productivity ought to mean _achieving more in an hour of work_, but it has come to mean _extracting more with an hour of pay._
* There's no such thing as overtime: overtime is almost always followed by an equal period of compensatory "undertone."
* If you, the manager, exploit your workers to the hilt, _you will eventually lose them._
* When measuring _productivity_, always factor in _employee turnover._
* **People under time pressure don't work better, they just work faster.**
