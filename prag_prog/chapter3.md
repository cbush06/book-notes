# Chapter 3 — The Basic Tools

Every craftsman needs a basic set of good quality tools. Tools make your more efficient and more effective. As you master them, your productivity will skyrocket. You should start with a set of generalized tools and gradually add to your tool bag as you encounter new problems and discover new tools to help you solve them. Many practitioners make the mistake of adopting a single *swiss army knife*, such as a particular integrated development environment (IDE), office suite, or publishing software, and never leave its cozy interface.

Contrast this with text stored in a particular text editor format (e.g. Word, WordPerfect, Adobe Acrobat, etc.).
