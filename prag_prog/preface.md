# Preface

1. There are no “silver bullets” (no perfect methodology, no best language, no best OS)
2. You adjust your approach to suit each problem and environment (some tools are better suited to some problems than others)

## What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?

> **What do you gain by taking the time to think about how you do your work?**<br/>
> The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement. Over the long term, your time investment will be repaid as you and your team become more efficient, write code that’s easier to maintain, and spend less time in meetings. — pg. xx

1. Developers have their own strengths and weaknesses. Each will craft a personal environment (editors, IDEs, languages, OS, scripts, etc.).
2. Pragmatic Programmers:
    1. Early adopter: enjoy trying the latest technologies
    2. Inquisitive: want to know how/why things work
    3. Critical thinker: don't take things at face value
    4. Realistic: want to know the full scope of problems you're faced with
    5. Jack of all trades: familiarize yourself with broad range of technologies, environments, tools, techniques, etc.
3. **TIP 1: CARE ABOUT YOUR CRAFT** — No point in developing software unless you care about doing it well
4. **TIP 2: THINK ABOUT YOUR WORK — t**_hink about what you're doing while you're doing it._ 
    1. Critically assess every decision you make, every day, on every development.
    2. _Never run on autopilot._
    3. Constantly _critique_ your work.

## Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams

> **How can we rectify individuality within a structured, software engineering project?**<br/>
> Within the overall structure of a project there is always room for individuality and craftsmanship...One hundred years from now, our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today's civil engineers, while our craftsmanship will still be honored. 
— pg. xxi

1. Programmers *should *be allowed individuality!
2. Software Development *should* be an _engineering discipline_, but that doesn't preclude individual craftsmanship

## It's a Continuous Process

1. Work every day to refine your skills and add/learn new tools and techniques
2. Constantly be thinking about what you are doing, how you are doing, and how you could improve
